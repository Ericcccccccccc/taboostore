## Deployment Workflow

### First-Time Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Interactive wizard guides you through setup
./scripts/quick-start.sh
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Install system dependencies (one-time)
./scripts/install-dependencies.sh

# Log out and back in for Docker group membership

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.production.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your domain

# 3. Deploy application
./deploy.sh
```

### Updates & Redeployment
```bash
# Pull latest changes and redeploy
git pull origin main
./deploy.sh
```

### Maintenance Commands
```bash
# Check application health
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Create backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Start monitoring (runs continuously)
./scripts/monitor.sh

# Setup automatic startup on boot
./scripts/setup-systemd.sh
```

5. **Run Quick Start**: Execute `./scripts/quick-start.sh`
6. **Verify Deployment**: Check HTTPS at https://itaboo.store
7. **Setup Monitoring**: Run `./scripts/monitor.sh` in screen/tmux
8. **Schedule Backups**: Add cron job for `./scripts/backup.sh`

### Example Cron Jobs
```bash
# Daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /opt/taboostore && ./scripts/backup.sh

# Weekly health check report (optional)
0 0 * * 0 cd /opt/taboostore && ./scripts/health-check.sh | mail -s "Weekly Health Report" you@example.com
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Deployment Failed
```bash
# Check logs
cat deployment-*.log | tail -n 100

# Check container status
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Health Checks Failing
```bash
# Run health check
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Check specific service
curl http://localhost:5555/api/health
docker logs taboostore-backend
```

### HTTPS Not Working
```bash
# Check Caddy
sudo systemctl status caddy
sudo journalctl -u caddy -n 100

# Verify DNS
nslookup itaboo.store

# Validate Caddyfile
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```
